Part I: Research Question

A.  Describe the purpose of this data mining report by doing the following:

1.  Propose one question relevant to a real-world organizational situation that you will answer by using principal component analysis (PCA).

2.  Define one goal of the data analysis. Ensure that your goal is reasonable within the scope of the scenario and is represented in the available data.
 

Part II: Method Justification

B.  Explain the reasons for using PCA by doing the following:

1.  Explain how PCA analyzes the selected data set. Include expected outcomes.

2.  Summarize one assumption of PCA.
 

Part III: Data Preparation

C.  Perform data preparation for the chosen dataset by doing the following:

1.  Identify the continuous dataset variables that you will need in order to answer the PCA question proposed in part A1.

2.  Standardize the continuous dataset variables identified in part C1. Include a copy of the cleaned dataset.
 

Part IV: Analysis

D.  Perform PCA by doing the following:

1.  Determine the matrix of all the principal components.

2.  Identify the total number of principal components using the elbow rule or the Kaiser criterion. Include a screenshot of the scree plot.

3.  Identify the variance of each of the principal components identified in part D2.

4.  Identify the total variance captured by the principal components identified in part D2.

5.  Summarize the results of your data analysis.
 

Part V: Attachments

E.  Record the web sources used to acquire data or segments of third-party code to support the analysis. Ensure the web sources are reliable.
 

F.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
 

G.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
